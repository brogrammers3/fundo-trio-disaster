Application Of Technology In Disaster Management 

A disaster is an event or series of events that leads to sudden disruption of normal life, causing severe damage to life and property to an extent, that available social and economic protection mechanism are inadequate to cope.
Following is the proposed method to solve the problem.

Disaster Mitigation Occurs In Three Key Steps:
1.)	Prediction : GIS provides a tool for effective and efficient storage and manipulation of remotely sensed data and other spatial and non-spatial data types for both scientific management and policy oriented information. This can be used to facilitate measurement, mapping, monitoring and modeling of variety of data types related to natural phenomenon. Data obtained through various national agencies(NDIS and IMD) on a regular basis would be used to create a GIS module using either ArcGIS or ArcGIS portal. This GIS module would analyze the data and predict vulnerability of a particular area with respect to possible disasters. 
The GIS module provides an information model for a GIS hosted within ArcGIS Online or an instance of ArcGIS Enterprise hosted in  premises. This module provides functionality to manage (create, read, update and delete) GIS users, groups and content. This module is the most important and provides the entry point into the GIS.

2.)	Prevention : Though it is not possible to completely avoid the natural disasters, but the sufferings can be minimized by creating proper awareness of the likely disasters and its impact by developing a suitable warning system, disaster preparedness and management of disasters through application of information technology tools. 
Now warning system plays very important role in preventing a natural disaster. So, for it a mobile SMS or push alert would be sent to the people living in a particular area. This would be done by collaborating with cellular companies in that which provides a tunneling system connected to our GIS module which opens up in case warning is to be issued. Along with SMS alerts, voice alerts would also be sent in case any person misses out on seeing the SMS alert. Pictogram alerts can also be accommodated for helping out disabled people.

3.) Management: A Real Time Database containing information of families which have separated would start functioning as soon as the network  system in disaster hit area is restored. It would help people find their families easily. Local authorities would be connected to this network so that initial help can be provided immediately even before NDRF teams arrive. There would also be an option of real time management of stock of food and other necessities need to be supplied so that they reach to those who require them.

A website would host all these features with GIS module working in backend of webpage. Webpage would feature real time databse entries of people both during disaster and after it to prove of help in future , food supplies stock management, and all the data and information obtained from government agencies.
